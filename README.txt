Citation for nodejs-starter-app:
Date: 2/27/2025
Created CRUD functionality for 1 entity (purchases) based on the node-js-starter-app,
modified to work for an intersection table with two foreign keys (trial and error).  Also
modified the example .hms code (handlebars) to include navigation (main.hbs) and the first
.hms file (purchases).  I used the purchases (add.js, delete.js, update.js, app.js, purchases.hms)
as a blueprint for the rest of the .js and .hms files.
